# SkiResort
My amateur application for managing a ski resort database.
Program features:
1) Administration, namely the division of users into simple workers and administrators.
Employees can add new hotel customers and view other information from the database.
Administrators can perform all employee functions and also change and delete information from the database.
2) When entering the user's personal data, you can choose equipment for him using the entered parameters, you can also enter parameters for renting equipment for another person. All equipment is attached to the person who issues the hotel room.
3) The prices for the selected hotel room and equipment are added up and a pseudo payment is implemented (the program randomly decides whether the payment was successful or not and displays a corresponding message), if the payment was successful, the client's data and the equipment attached to him and the number are stored in the database.
4) In the case of successful payment, a check will be sent to the user's email, indicating the prices for all services and the summary.
All input fields are protected by validation and null checks.
The database is located on a remote server.
The project was written without comments, but I tried to write a clean cat and I am proud of this project.
The whole project contains too many elements, so it was only possible to upload it to Hithub as an archive.
